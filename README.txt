The way that we implemented our first solution was by creating functions such as init_grid and findLoc and createNode to set up our grid, and then we had global mutex lock that would lock the critical region, which was in between finding the current space and creting another thead, and then joining the threads at the end printing the nodes and their messages as well as their location. THe second solution worked similarly.
